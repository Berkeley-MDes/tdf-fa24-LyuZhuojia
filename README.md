# Github Background Information & Context
If you‚Äôre new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that‚Äôs hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it‚Äôs super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link!  As a start, feel free to simply add images to the `/assets` folder, which is located [here](/assets). 

The specific file that I‚Äôm typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (üí° TIP: The .md indicates that we‚Äôre using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (üí° TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis üòÑ</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the ‚Äúfront page‚Äù of your GitHub repo. This is where we‚Äôll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/24f-desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions#weekly-progress-report). They might look something like this: ###

# Week 1: Report 1 #
## Week of 09/05/2024

This week, I took a class on immersive technology, and it reminded me of the movie READY PLAYER ONE, which I really enjoyed, it also brought back memories of the Disney designed floors-HoloTile Floor, that I had seen before, which are very important for the development of future virtual reality games.

# Week 2: Report 1 #
## Week of 09/09/2024
I just want to try the grasshopper, as I never used it before.

I hope the phone stand I design can be unique and highly desirable, so I would like its shape to be inspired by some beautiful creatures. 
I first thought of an octopus, with its many tentacles that could be used to support the phone. I used MidJourney to generate a similar image. Although it‚Äôs not very detailed, it captures exactly the feeling I‚Äôm going for.

And I also think of the fragile and beautiful creature, butterfly, it inspired me.

but it seems not taht good, I need to improve it to make it become a cell phone stand, simplify the lines of two wings and make its feet and body to support teh object.
